    <p>the briard which is believed to have orginated in france has been bred for centuries to herd and
        to protect sheep. the breed was used by the french army as sentries, messengers and to search for 
        wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing briards were used in the first world war almost
        to the point of extinction. currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. charlemagne,
       napoleon, thomas jefferson and lafayette all owned briards.
